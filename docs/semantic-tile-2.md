# Semantic Tile 2

Instead of block World, alternative route is Pixel World.

In the Pixel world, each pixels don't have much information. It only has the palette color (token) and each palette color is linked with a latent vector.

The latent vector is generated by clip embedding of text.

The generation of what pixel "value" should be is heavily reliant on (1) overall setting of the map and (2) near by pixels.

In this worldview, each pixel does not mean much.

It is the configuration of bunch of pixels that makes all the difference.

## Labeling

Labeling is done at pixel level of generated pixel art map.

Default state is blank and it just tells that region is background.

Then you mark the foreground with different palette indices (each indices link to a semantic latent vector that describes what it is).

This requires that a map or a scene has limited number of "things" and does not look incoherent.

This also allows for pixel perfect rendering.

## What it offers

Now, we can define a walkable areas by pixel level.

This gives us super high fidelity.

## Limitations

Agents will now live in a world like Lemmings and Worms.

The dynamics totally changes.

The biggest of all is the world size.

World size may be the biggest limiting factor in all this because simulation may happen at pixel scale rather than at block scale.
